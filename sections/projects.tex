\noindent
\textbf{Eagle AI}
% currently, home security systems like Ring send an alert that notifies of movement detected, but it does not give any more information.
% Eagle AI uses Gemini in order to process the video and sends a smart text message notification that classifies a threat level and sends a concise description of the event in the video. This allows the user to make a more informed decision on how to respond to the alert.
% we used the google Nest api to get the live video feed
% we used the YOLO model to detect people and start recording frames when a person is detected
% we used streamlit to demo the project in the browser
